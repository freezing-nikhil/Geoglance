#  Where in the World? â€“ Country Information App

A responsive web application that displays information about countries using the **REST Countries API**.  
You can search for a country, filter by region, and view detailed information such as population, capital, borders, currencies, and languages.  
Includes a **Dark Mode toggle** and works smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices.

##  Project Structure
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html # Main page with country list, search, and filter
â”œâ”€â”€ country.html # Detail page for selected country
â”œâ”€â”€ main.js # Handles country list fetching, search, and filtering
â”œâ”€â”€ country.js # Handles single country details fetching
â”œâ”€â”€ style.css # Styling for light and dark mode
â””â”€â”€ README.md # Project documentation



##  How It Works
1. **Fetch all countries** on page load (`main.js`).
2. Display them as **cards** with flag, name, population, region, and capital.
3. **Search bar** filters by country name in real-time.
4. **Region dropdown** filters by continent.
5. Clicking on a country card redirects to `country.html` with its name in the query string.
6. `country.js` fetches full details for that country and displays them.
7. **Dark mode toggle** switches the theme and stores preference in `localStorage`.
